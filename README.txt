#About Project

This is a Full Stack Project created using MDBBootstrap and PHP.

The project contains two pages namely the login and the admin ui. With proper validations the login page asks a new user to register using name, email and password.
After registering the user can now login to the admin ui page.

The admin ui page contains a table showing the id, profile image, name, email, profession, message, years of experience and an action column having two buttons to edit the details or delete it.
The logged in user can add a new user, search an existing user, perform the edit and delete operations.

The logged in details are shown below the table along w ith a logout button to log out of the admin ui page.
Every details of the logged in user along with their hashed password and the details of users who are added to the admin ui page are stored in two separate tables in the same database.
